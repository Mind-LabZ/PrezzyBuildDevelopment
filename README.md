# Paper Tear WebGL Template with Loading Screen

This WebGL template includes a beautiful loading screen that covers the background until Unity loads completely.

## Features

### Loading Screen
- **Full-screen overlay** that prevents website background from showing during Unity load
- **Animated progress bar** with real-time percentage updates
- **Smooth transitions** with fade-out animation when Unity is ready
- **Responsive design** that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Contextual loading messages** that change based on progress:
  - 0-30%: "Initializing..."
  - 30-70%: "Loading assets..."
  - 70-95%: "Almost ready..."
  - 95-100%: "Starting experience..."

### Visual Elements
- **Gradient background** matching your game's theme
- **Animated spinner** with smooth rotation
- **Floating elements** with subtle animations
- **Typography** with gradient text effects
- **Loading tips** to engage users during wait time

### Technical Features
- **Progress tracking** via Unity's loading callback
- **Error handling** with user-friendly error messages
- **Smooth fade transition** (0.5s) when hiding loading screen
- **Mobile optimization** with responsive breakpoints
- **Transparent Unity canvas** once loaded

## How It Works

1. **Initial Load**: Loading screen appears immediately when page loads
2. **Progress Updates**: Unity's loading progress is displayed in real-time
3. **Completion**: Loading screen fades out smoothly when Unity is ready
4. **Error Handling**: Shows error message if Unity fails to load

## Customization
